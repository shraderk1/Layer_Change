# Layer Change G-code Tool

This Python application provides a GUI to open a G-code file, swap the first and fifth layers (while maintaining the Z coordinates of the first layer), and save the modified file. The GUI offers user feedback and validation to ensure the operation is performed correctly.

## Features
- Open and parse G-code files
- Swap the first and fifth layers, keeping layer 1's Z coordinates
- GUI for easy interaction and feedback
- Save the modified G-code file

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.8 or newer.
2. Run `python main.py` in this directory.

## Next Steps
- Build the GUI and core logic in `main.py`.
- Add error handling and user feedback.
